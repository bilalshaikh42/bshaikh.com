I am a biomedical software developer with a background in biochemistry and computer science. My interests are varied, including machine learning, distributed and high-performance computing systems, and molecular and mathematical models of cells and disease. I am interested in developing tools to enable large-scale simulation and analysis of biology through the application of computational technologies, with the ultimate goal of allowing predictive tools that can elucidate molecular pathways and enable personalized medicine.

Currently, I am the lead developer for the BioSimulations project and am working towards a masterâ€™s degree in computer science, focusing on machine learning.
