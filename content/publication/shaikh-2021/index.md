abstract: Comprehensive, predictive computational models have significant
  potential for science, bioengineering, and medicine. One promising way to
  achieve more predictive models is to combine submodels of multiple subsystems.
  To capture the multiple scales of biology, these submodels will likely require
  multiple modeling frameworks and simulation algorithms. Several community
  resources are already available for working with many of these frameworks and
  algorithms. However, the variety and sheer number of these resources make it
  challenging to find and use appropriate tools for each model, especially for
  novice modelers and experimentalists. To make these resources easier to use,
  we developed RunBioSimulations (https://run.biosimulations.org), a single web
  application for executing a broad range of models. RunBioSimulations leverages
  community resources, including BioSimulators, a new open registry of
  simulation tools. These resources currently enable RunBioSimulations to
  execute nine frameworks and 44 algorithms, and they make RunBioSimulations
  extensible to additional frameworks and algorithms. RunBioSimulations also
  provides features for sharing simulations and interactively visualizing their
  results. We anticipate that RunBioSimulations will foster reproducibility,
  stimulate collaboration, and ultimately facilitate the creation of more
  predictive models.
