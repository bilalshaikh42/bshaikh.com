title: "SED-ML Validator: tool for debugging simulation experiments"
abstract: >
  More sophisticated models are needed to address problems in bioscience,
  synthetic biology, and precision medicine. To help facilitate the
  collaboration needed for such models, the community developed the Simulation
  Experiment Description Markup Language (SED-ML), a common format for
  describing simulations. However, the utility of SED-ML has been hampered by
  limited support for SED-ML among modeling software tools and by different
  interpretations of SED-ML among the tools that support the format. To help
  modelers debug their simulations and to push the community to use SED-ML
  consistently, we developed a tool for validating SED-ML files. We have used
  the validator to correct the official SED-ML example files. We plan to use the
  validator to correct the files in the BioModels database so that they can be
  simulated. We anticipate that the validator will be a valuable tool for
  developing more predictive simulations and that the validator will help
  increase the adoption and interoperability of SED-ML.
