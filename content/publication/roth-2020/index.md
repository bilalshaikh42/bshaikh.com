abstract: Integrative research about multiple biochemical subsystems has
  significant potential to help advance biology, bioengineering and medicine.
  However, it is difficult to obtain the diverse data needed for integrative
  research. To facilitate biochemical research, we developed
  [Datanator](https://datanator.info), an integrated database and set of tools
  for finding clouds of multiple types of molecular data about specific
  molecules and reactions in specific organisms and environments, as well as
  data about chemically-similar molecules and reactions in
  phylogenetically-similar organisms in similar environments. Currently,
  Datanator includes metabolite concentrations, RNA modifications and
  half-lives, protein abundances and modifications, and reaction rate constants
  about a broad range of organisms. Going forward, we aim to launch a community
  initiative to curate additional data. Datanator also provides tools for
  filtering, visualizing and exporting these data clouds. We believe that
  Datanator can facilitate a wide range of research from integrative mechanistic
  models, such as whole-cell models, to comparative data-driven analyses of
  multiple organisms.
