abstract: Non-canonical residues, caps, crosslinks, and nicks are important to
  many functions of DNAs, RNAs, proteins, and complexes. However, we do not
  fully understand how networks of such non-canonical macromolecules generate
  behavior. One barrier is our limited formats for describing macromolecules. To
  overcome this barrier, we develop BpForms and BcForms, a toolkit for
  representing the primary structure of macromolecules as combinations of
  residues, caps, crosslinks, and nicks. The toolkit can help omics researchers
  perform quality control and exchange information about macromolecules, help
  systems biologists assemble global models of cells that encompass processes
  such as post-translational modification, and help bioengineers design cells.
